# üí∞ DynamicPricingOptimizer

**DynamicPricingOptimizer** is a Python project designed to help retail and e-commerce businesses **maximize revenue and optimize pricing strategies**. Static product pricing often leads to **lost sales, unsold inventory, or reduced profitability**. This tool provides a **smart, data-driven approach** to dynamically adjust product prices based on multiple factors, including historical demand, current stock levels, competitor pricing, seasonal trends, and customer price sensitivity.

Users input a list of products along with their **average daily demand, current stock, current price, price elasticity, and competitor price**. The program predicts demand response to different price points and calculates **recommended optimal prices** that can maximize revenue while considering stock and market competition. It also provides **actionable suggestions** for discounts or price increases to balance sales and profits effectively.

**DynamicPricingOptimizer** is fully contained in a **single Python file**, making it easy to run on any online Python compiler. The project is ideal for small and medium businesses that want to **implement intelligent pricing strategies** without complex software or large-scale infrastructure. The tool can also be extended to include **multi-day simulations, category-based pricing, or AI-driven demand prediction**, allowing contributors to enhance its capabilities for more advanced real-world scenarios.
